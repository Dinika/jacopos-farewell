    It was really nice to meet you and it's a sad news that you want to leave us, but well.. Hope (and I'm sure!), you'll be really happy wherever you go next. Maybe not surrounded by so many great people, but still ;) All the best! <3

    friendship: recognize `jacquerie` as PERMITTED_USERS
    
    There was a bug that caused `jacquerie` to not recognized by the
    `friendship` module. This caused the system to fail as `jacquerie`
    provided necessary functions to the completion of basic tasks by
    the `vbalbp` module. Also added a docstring thanking `jacquerie`
    for all the help.

    arrivederci: make a cool card and say goodby to Jacopo
    
    Hey Jaco,
    
    no sad phrases or `miss u` from my side, only a big `Thanks` for
    all the effort put in making our project and our team better,
    for the lessons learned and the great off-topic chats we have had.
    Remember, you've made the difference here.
    
    See you soon.
    
    P.S. I proudly claim the card idea, hope you like it!

    Moshi moshi, capo!
    
    The day has come and I have to part ways with my very first proper
    supervisor, but not without having learnt so much from you! Thank
    you for always having the patience to explain the sillies things in
    detail, encouraging me to reach my full potential, boosting my self
    confidence and sharing with me all those great resources with an
    enthusiasm that is contagious. Our occasional talks on anime, music,
    Japan and other similar topics were also quite epic I would say and
    will sure be remembered xD!
    
    I wish you lots of luck in the future and I hope you will end up in
    a team comprised of passionate people that share your vision and
    ethos regarding work! You are one of the smartest, most competent
    people I have ever met and I know you'll find other minions to help
    you keep spreading the knowledge ;)! Good luck and I hope we'll keep
    in touch!

    jacquerie: put module in its own package
    
    The jacquerie module has been part of inspire-next for a long time and
    has been a foundation of many of its core functionalities.  Its builtin
    linter had a tendency of being very strict and printing angry messages.
    However, it also provided very valuable and entertaining information and
    will be missed.
    
    As an independent package, the module will hopefully be maintained by a
    new team so that it can be deployed in a proper environment, either
    on premise or in the cloud.
    
    In the future, the module will be rewritten in C++ on a mechanical
    keyboard using algorithms with optimal complexity.

    Hey man,
    
    It was great working with you, even though it was a very short period.
    We never did the hackathon for workflows :P but don't worry we'll replace
    them soon!
    
    I wish you all the very best for the future and hope you'll
    invite me for a tour at Google.
    
    Best,

    My friend,
    
    it was exciting, at times :P, working with you.
    Thanks for the great contribution you gave to CERN
    and for everything you taught me.
    Good luck for your next adventures and keep up with
    the positiveness and the small PRs.

        * INCOMPATIBLE: After all these years of working together, and trying to
          push good stuff, it's always sad to say goodbye. Even though things have
          not gone the way you planned, your contributions to the project are and

    It was good to be able to learn from one of the best programmers I've known

    All the best, Jacopo!
    
    It was a pleasure working with you all those months, and as you
    were my first (albeit unofficial) supervisor, I am especially
    grateful for you welcoming me to the team. As sad as it might be
    to see you go, I sincerely hope that wherever you'll end up,
    you'll be appreciated as you're definitely one of the smartest
    humans I've met (:
    
    So I wish you all the best, and also concur what Dinika said:
    don't be a stranger... and we need to see that youtube channel!

    Looking forward to the youtube videos
    
    Heyo Jacopo
    I still don't see any new uploads on your channel. If you were
    staying here longer I would make another bet with you and most
    certainly win that one too. Ooh if you're still looking for song
    suggestions check out 'The walls came down' by The Call.
    I will miss you Jacopo. Thanks for teaching me all those git (and
    so many other) things so patiently. I wish you all the happiness
    and good luck (not that you need it). Don't be a stranger, okay
    - shoot a message sometime.
    
    A big hug to you
